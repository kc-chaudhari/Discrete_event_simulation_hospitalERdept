# Project hw_3 notes

 
How to execute the project: 

1. Please read the process in the data folder for understanding
2. Run the ER_simulation.py file inside the notebook folder- this contains all the processes for Emergency Room analysis
3. Run the ER_simulation_scenarios.py inside same folder for creating various scenarios. I have already added couple scenarios. We can add more scenarios at the place where it is written # Add more scenarios here as needed. All scenarions will be incorporated directly. Please see the parameters in this file you can edit it however you want. Parameters are not hard coded. 
4. The graph and other output will be displayed in python whereas the log file is exported in the output folder which can be further used for analysis
5. In Input file a config file will be generated on basis of the paramters we use in the scenarios in ER_simulation_scenarios.py

Note: This process assumes exponential function for arrivals/registration and normal function for all other process. This function is hard coded.
